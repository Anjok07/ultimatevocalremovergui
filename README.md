  <summary>MacOS Users: Having Trouble Opening UVR?</summary>

> Due to Apples strict application security, you may need to follow these steps to open UVR.
>
> First, run the following command via Terminal.app to allow applications to run from all sources (it's recommended that you re-enable this once UVR opens properly.)
> 
> ```bash
> sudo spctl --master-disable
> ```
> 
> Second, run the following command to bypass Notarization:

### Manual MacOS Installation

- Download and save this repository [here](https://github.com/Anjok07/ultimatevocalremovergui/archive/refs/heads/master.zip)
- Download and install Python 3.10 [here](https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.10.9/python-3.10.9-macos11.pkg)
- From the saved directory run the following - 

```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

- If your Mac is running with an M1, please run the following command next. If not, skip this step. - 

```
cp /Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.10/lib/python3.10/site-packages/_soundfile_data/libsndfile_arm64.dylib /Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.10/lib/python3.10/site-packages/_soundfile_data/libsndfile.dylib
```

**FFmpeg Installation**

- Once everything is done installing, download the correct FFmpeg binary for your system [here](http://www.osxexperts.net) and place it into the main application directory.

**Rubber Band Installation**

In order to use the Time Stretch or Change Pitch tool, you'll need Rubber Band.

- Download the precompiled build [here](https://breakfastquay.com/files/releases/rubberband-3.1.2-gpl-executable-windows.zip)
- From the archive, extract the following files to the UVR/lib_v5 application directory:
   - ```rubberband-3.1.2-gpl-executable-macos/rubberband```

This process has been tested on a MacBook Pro 2021 (using M1) and a MacBook Air 2017 and is confirmed to be working on both.

### Linux Installation

<details id="LinuxInstall">
  <summary>See Linux Installation Instructions</summary>

<br />
    
**These install instructions are for Debian & Arch based Linux systems.**

- Download and save this repository [here](https://github.com/Anjok07/ultimatevocalremovergui/archive/refs/heads/master.zip)
- From the saved directory run the following commands in this order- 

**For Debian Based (Ubuntu, Mint, etc.):**
```
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt install ffmpeg
sudo apt install python3-pip
sudo apt-get -y install python3-tk
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
python3 UVR.py
```

**For Arch Based (EndeavourOS):**
```
sudo pacman -Syu
sudo pacman -Sy
sudo pacman -S python-pip
sudo pacman -S --noconfirm tk
sudo pacman -S ffmpeg
```

To bypass environment setup and proceed with the installation, use:

- Take caution; this modifies system files.

```
sudo rm /usr/lib/python3.11/EXTERNALLY-MANAGED
```

Then proceed with the following in order:

```
chmod +x install_packages.sh
./install_packages.sh
python UVR.py
```

</details>

### Other Application Notes
- Nvidia RTX 1060 6GB is the minimum requirement for GPU conversions.
- Nvidia GPUs with at least 8GBs of V-RAM are recommended.
- AMD Radeon GPUs are not supported at this time.
- This application is only compatible with 64-bit platforms. 
- This application relies on the Rubber Band library for the Time-Stretch and Pitch-Shift options.
- This application relies on FFmpeg to process non-wav audio files.
- The application will automatically remember your settings when closed.
- Conversion times will significantly depend on your hardware. 
- These models are computationally intensive. 

### Performance:
- Model load times are faster.
- Importing/exporting audio files is faster.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

- If FFmpeg is not installed, the application will throw an error if the user attempts to convert a non-WAV file.
- Memory allocation errors can usually be resolved by lowering the "Segment" or "Window" sizes.

#### MacOS Sonoma Left-click Bug
There's a known issue on MacOS Sonoma where left-clicks aren't registering correctly within the app. This seems to be impacting all applications built with Tkinter on Sonoma.

Temporary solutions:
- Ensure you move your mouse slightly when left-clicking within the application; this ensures the left-click is registered.
- I'm developing a temporary fix that lets you use the middle mouse button or space bar as substitutes for left-clicks until the issue is fully resolved.

This issue is being tracked [here](https://github.com/Anjok07/ultimatevocalremovergui/issues/840).

### Issue Reporting

Please be as detailed as possible when posting a new issue. 

If possible, click the "Settings Button" to the left of the "Start Processing" button and click the "Error Log" button for detailed error information that can be provided to us.
