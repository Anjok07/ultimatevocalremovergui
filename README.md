# Ultimate Vocal Remover v5 Command Line Beta

## About

This application is a heavily modified version of the vocal remover AI created and posted by GitHub user [tsurumeso](https://github.com/tsurumeso). You can find tsurumeso's original command line version [here](https://github.com/tsurumeso/vocal-remover). The official v5 GUI is still under developement and will be released some time in Q3 2021.

## Installation

### Install Required Applications & Packages

Please run the requirements command even if you have v4 installed!

Recommended way is to create venv and install all requirements to it. Don't forget to activate with second command before using the next time.

```
python3 -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt
pip install torch==1.8.1+cu111 torchvision==0.9.1+cu111 torchaudio===0.8.1 -f https://download.pytorch.org/whl/torch_stable.html
```

### FFmpeg 

FFmpeg must be installed and configured in order for the application to be able to process any track that isn't a *.wav* file. Instructions for installing FFmpeg can be found on YouTube, WikiHow, Reddit, GitHub, and many other sources around the web.

- **Note:** If you are experiencing any errors when attempting to process any media files that are not in the *.wav* format, please ensure FFmpeg is installed & configured correctly.

## Running Inferences & Model Details

Each model requires specific parameters to run smoothly. Those parameters are intricately defined within the JSON files provided. Please make sure the correct JSON files are selected when running inferences!

### Option Guide

Please note, this version is based on vocal-remover 4.0.0 of tsurumeso's original code. Significant improvements and changes were made. Those changes include the following - 

- New format of spectrograms. Instead of a single spectrogram with a fixed FFT size, combined spectrograms are now used. This version combines several different types of spectrograms within specific frequency ranges. This approach allowed for a clearer view of the high frequencies and good resolutions at low frequencies, thus allowing for more targeted vocal removals.
- The arguments --sr, --n_fft, --hop_length are removed. JSON files are now used instead.
- The following new features were added
	- **--high_end_process** - This argument restores the high frequencies of the output audio. It is intended for models with a narrow bandwidth, 16 kHz and below. The 5 choices for this argument are:
		- *none* - No processing (default)
		- *bypass* - This copies the missing frequencies from the input.
		- *correlation* - This also copies missing frequencies from the input, however, the magnitude of the copied frequency will depend on the magnitude of the generated instrumental's high frequencies. It will be removed in the final release.
		- *mirroring* - This algorithm is more advanced than *correlation*. It uses the high frequencies from the input and mirrored instrumental's frequencies.
		- *mirroring2* - This version of mirroring is optimized for better performance.
	- **--aggressiveness** - This argument allows you to set how strong the vocal removal will be. The range is 0.0-1.0 The higher the value, the more the vocals will be removed. Please note, the highest value can result in muddy sounding instrumentals depending on the track being converted, so this isn't always recommended. The default is 0.1. For the vocal model specifically, the recommended value is 0.5-0.6.
	- **--deepextraction** - This argument generates an additional instrumental output with deep artifact vocal removal. This option is experimental and is more suited for acoustic or other light types of tracks with stubborn vocals. Many others might sound bad.

### Models Included

All of the models included in the release were trained on large datasets containing diverse sets of music genres. These are all beta models that may or may not make it into the final release. We are working to have even better models in the final release of v5! You can download the model pack [here](https://github.com/Anjok07/ultimatevocalremovergui/releases/tag/5.0.0)

**Please Note:** These models are *not* compatible with the v4 GUI! The GUI for v5 is still under development.

### Inference Command Structure

The following example shows how to run a model from the "2band_32000 Models" section above.
```
python inference.py -g 0 -m modelparams/2band_32000.json -P models/MGM-v5-2Band-32000-BETA1.pth -i "INPUT"
```

The following examples show how to run the ensemble model scripts -

```
python ensemble_inference.py -g 0 -i "INPUT"
```

Or if you wish to save all individual outputs generated in addition to the final ensembled outputs, please run the following - 

```
python ensemble_inference.py -g 0 -s -i "INPUT"
```

By default, 14 models will be ensembled. However, you can also specify the models you wish to ensemble. For the ensemble_inference script specifically, do not input the ".pth" extension within the command, only the name. Here is an example - 

```
python ensemble_inference.py -g 0 -P "MODELNAME1" "MODELNAME2" "MODELNAME3" -i "INPUT"
```

- **Please Note the Following:** 
	- Do not specify the model parameters or architectures for the ensemble inference script. Those details are already fixed. 
	- When ensembling models with low and high bandwidth conversions, '--bypass' is highly recommended.
	- The ensembled outputs generated through the ensemble scripts can be found in the "ensembled" folder.

### Ensembler

The stand alone ensembler has the ability to take 2 or more instrumental or vocal outputs generated by different models and combine the best results from all of them! Here is how to use it manually - 

- For instrumental outputs, run the following command: 

```
python lib/spec_utils.py -a min_mag -m modelparams/1band_sr44100_hl512.json "INPUT1" "INPUT2" -o "CHOOSEFILENAME"
```

- For vocal outputs, run the following command: 

```
python lib/spec_utils.py -a max_mag -m modelparams/1band_sr44100_hl512.json "INPUT1" "INPUT2" -o "CHOOSEFILENAME"
```

To automate the ensembling process, please use the 'Ensemble-Outputs.bat' script reference below.

### Windows Batch Files

We included the following Windows batch files to help automate commands:
- Drag-n-Drop-CHOOSE-YOUR-MODEL.bat
	- Simply drag the audio file you wish to convert into the 'Drag-n-Drop-CHOOSE-YOUR-MODEL.bat' file provided. 
	- From there you will be asked if you want TTA enabled, then prompted to type the letter associated with the model you wish to run and hit "enter". 
	- Once you hit enter, you will be asked fs you want an additional "deep extraction" instrumental output in addition to the 2 to be provided.

- Ensemble-Outputs.bat
	- Simply drag the instrumental or vocal outputs you wish to ensemble into the batch script. 
	- From there you will be asked if the outputs are instrumental or not.
	- Once you hit enter, the script will take a moment to ensemble the outputs.
	- The ensembled outputs can be found in the "ensembled" folder.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

- This application is not compatible with 32-bit versions of Python. Please make sure your version of Python is 64-bit. 
- If FFmpeg is not installed, the application will throw an error if the user attempts to convert a non-WAV file.

### Issue Reporting

Please be as detailed as possible when posting a new issue. Make sure to provide any error outputs and/or screenshots/gif's to give us a clearer understanding of the issue you are experiencing.

If you are unable to run conversions *under any circumstances* and all other resources have been exhausted, please do the following - 

1. Copy and paste the error output shown in the cmd prompt to the issues center on the GitHub repository.
