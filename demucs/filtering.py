    estimates.

    This algorithm allows to make source separation results better by
    enforcing multichannel consistency for the estimates. This usually means
    a better perceptual quality in terms of spatial artifacts.

    The implementation follows the details presented in [1]_, taking
    inspiration from the original EM algorithm proposed in [2]_ and its
    weighted refinement proposed in [3]_, [4]_.
    It works by iteratively:

     * Re-estimate source parameters (power spectral densities and spatial
       covariance matrices) through :func:`get_local_gaussian_model`.

     * Separate again the mixture with the new parameters by first computing
       the new modelled mixture covariance matrices with :func:`get_mix_model`,
       prepare the Wiener filters through :func:`wiener_gain` and apply them
       with :func:`apply_filter``.

    Notes:
        * You need an initial estimate for the sources to apply this
          algorithm. This is precisely what the :func:`wiener` function does.
        * This algorithm *is not* an implementation of the "exact" EM
          proposed in [1]_. In particular, it does compute the posterior
          covariance matrices the same (exact) way. Instead, it uses the
          simplified approximate scheme initially proposed in [5]_ and further
          refined in [3]_, [4]_, that boils down to just take the empirical
          covariance of the recent source estimates, followed by a weighted
          average for the update of the spatial covariance matrix. It has been
          empirically demonstrated that this simplified algorithm is more
          robust for music separation.

    Warning:
        It is *very* important to make sure `x.dtype` is `torch.float64`
        if you want double precision, because this function will **not**
        do such conversion for you from `torch.complex32`, in case you want the
        smaller RAM usage on purpose.

        It is usually always better in terms of quality to have double
        precision, by e.g. calling :func:`expectation_maximization`
        with ``x.to(torch.float64)``.

    The method uses the (possibly multichannel) spectrograms  of the
    sources to separate the (complex) Short Term Fourier Transform  of the
    mix. Separation is done in a sequential way by:

    * Getting an initial estimate. This can be done in two ways: either by
      directly using the spectrograms with the mixture phase, or
      by using a softmasking strategy. This initial phase is controlled
      by the `softmask` flag.

    * If required, adding an additional residual target as the mix minus
      all targets.

    * Refinining these initial estimates through a call to
      :func:`expectation_maximization` if the number of iterations is nonzero.

    This implementation also allows to specify the epsilon value used for
    regularization. It is based on [1]_, [2]_, [3]_, [4]_.

            with the sum of them all. This strategy is better if the model are
            not really good, and worse otherwise.

            performed, i.e. when softmasking and when iterating the EM.
