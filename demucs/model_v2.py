    The function first checks the value of 'demucs_model_name' to determine the value of the 'channels' variable. If '48' is present in 'demucs_model_name', 'channels' is set to 48. If 'unittest' is present in 'demucs_model_name', 'channels' is set to 4. Otherwise, 'channels' is set to 64.

    Next, the function checks if 'tasnet' is present in 'demucs_model_name'. If so, it initializes 'init_demucs_model' using the 'ConvTasNet' class with the 'sources' parameter and X=10. Otherwise, it initializes 'init_demucs_model' using the 'Demucs' class with the 'sources' and 'channels' parameters.
